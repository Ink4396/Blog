  <li><strong>computer:</strong>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.</li>
  <li><strong>computer science:</strong>Computer science is the study of computation and information. Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and applications.</li>
  <li><strong>software:</strong>software is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.</li>
  <li><strong>software engineering:</strong>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.</li>
  <li><strong>Alan Turing:</strong>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, 
      providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, 
      which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.<br/>
  <li><strong>Moore's law:</strong>Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.</li>
